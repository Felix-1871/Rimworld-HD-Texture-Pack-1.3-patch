## Original description
Changes most of the games terrain to HD realistic textures. The textures are much more detailed but *technically* lower-res than before so you should notice a substantial increase in your FPS; nearly doubling it especially with larger colonies.

*NOTE*
Not all texture changes are shown in the screenshots.

Does the game look better/worse?
No, it just looks different.
